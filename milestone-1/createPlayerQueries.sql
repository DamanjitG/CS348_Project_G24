-- CREATE CUSTOM PLAYER: (Players Relation name is TENTATIVE)
INSERT INTO Players (player, age, team, pos...)
-- FIX TO INCLUDE THE CORRECT ATTRIBUTES WHEN CHOSEN^


DELETE FROM Players
WHERE Players.name = '' 
--should probably show the users a list of players 
-- and get the metadata that way (from FE)?
