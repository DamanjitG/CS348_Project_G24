# Milestone 1 Setup


You will need Python installed in order to run the code for milestone 1.


First, make sure your current directory is the milestone-1 folder, not the root of the repository. Run

 `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
 
 to install the required libraries. If this doesn't work however, simply manually install Numpy and Pandas.

 To create the database, you want to run 

 `python createDB.py`

 This will create an `sqlTest.db` file which contains the database. You can then run

 `python queryDB.py`

 to execute some sample queries and see the results.
