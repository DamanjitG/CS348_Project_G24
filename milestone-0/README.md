Milestone 0:

You will need Python installed in order to run the sample code for milestone 0. Newer Python installs should come with the package needed for sqlite3.

In order to load and test the sample database, please use the two scripts located in the milestone-0 folder. Running createDB.py will create a sample database and load it with two rows of data. Running queryDB.py will then run a few simple queries and print their outputs. If you want to run any further tests, you can create and execute queries the way it is done in the two files, by creating a query string and using it as the argument in cursor.execute().
